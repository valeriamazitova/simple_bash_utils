# simple_bash_utils

Development of Bash text utilities: cat, grep.

Description:
- To see how my implementation of cat command works, first, enter src/cat/ directory.
- In the terminal, enter 'make all' or 'make s21_cat' to compile the programm.
- To run the functional tests, type in the terminal 'sh test_func_cat.sh'.
- To test program for memory leaks enter the command 'sh test_leak_cat.sh' in the terminal.
- To test the program for memory leaks using valgrind use test_valgrind_cat.sh file.

- To see for yourself that theprogram works like the original cat command, you can type in the terminal './s21_cat test_1_cat.txt'. It is a test file, you can use your own text file, like you would normally do as follows 'cat test.txt' (for example). Just change 'cat' to './s21_cat'.

Same thing as for grep command in the src/grep directory.
